Being a person that had studied Ruby and Ruby on Rails and never having learnt PHP before beginning this challenge, I first had to learn enough to complete it, or complete as much of it as I could before the due date. I had previously bought some courses in PHP through Udemy and narrowed it down to one course, [PHP for Beginners by Edwin Diaz](https://www.udemy.com/php-for-complete-beginners-includes-msql-object-oriented/learn/v4/overview).

## 18 December - 24 December

This was the main period that I spend studying PHP. I worked my way through functions, variable & scopes, returning values from functions, loops, working with databases (mySQL using Apache, Xampp, and myPHPAdmin).

I then moved on to classes, sessions, cookies and how to set them up, the POST and GET super global. A bit was covered on encryption, refactoring to make it easier to read by using what I know of as partials in Ruby on Rails.
